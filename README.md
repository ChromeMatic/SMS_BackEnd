The name of this project is School Management Syetem, this is the repo for the Backend component of the project. In this component the login and authentication along with the business logic, will be built with Spring boot, some of the components that will be used are spring data JPA  (Java Persistence API), which allows Java objects to exist even after the application has ended. This is useful in the creation of tables within the database. And to keep the information secure we will be using spring security.
